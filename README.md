# Modelfarm-Proxy

Modelfarm-Proxy is a reverse proxy for the Modelfarm API. It allows you to use Modelfarm on your local machine, which is particularly useful until Replit supports Rust.

## Setup

To set up the Modelfarm-Proxy, you need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can do so by following the instructions on the official Rust website.

Once you have Rust installed, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/modelfarm-proxy.git
cd modelfarm-proxy
```

## Running the Proxy

To run the Modelfarm-Proxy, navigate to the root directory of the project and use the cargo run command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Note

Currently, the Modelfarm-Proxy only works if you run it from within a Replit deployment. We are working on making it compatible with other environments and will update the README when this is available.
